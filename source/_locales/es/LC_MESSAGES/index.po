"This course emphasizes network-based programming and Web applications, "
"how they work and how to program them in Python. Explore the underlying "
"principles and their expression in the Python libraries. Learn "
"contrasting approaches in creating applications: programming with the "
"low-level libraries versus using highly integrated frameworks"

"To attend this course you should have a working knowledge of the basic "
"syntax and structures of the Python programming language. You will also "
"need to be comfortable working at the command line to navigate a file "
"system, create and delete files, and execute commands. Finally, you "
"should have some basic knowledge of HTML."

"This course will cover the fundamental concepts of networked programming "

" communications between processes and machines and the basic protocols "
"that govern this communication, right up to the full-stack frameworks "
"that enable developers to build rich applications efficiently."

"Along the way, you'll learn through a combination of lecture and "
"activity. Historical information will be combined with exercises designed"
" to help you learn the Pythonic way to create programs that interact with"
" each-other across networks. Each module will include reading lists for "
"more information. Homework assignments will allow you to dive more deeply"
" into the concepts introduced in class."
